# JS-Crash-Course
## Description 
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript)Â is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## Learning process
I am following [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c&t=2s) and writing down learnings as I go. I will put key learnings and roadblocks in a bulleted list below
